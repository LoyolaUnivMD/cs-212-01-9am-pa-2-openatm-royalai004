In this programming assignment, I was tasked with creating an open ATM like the ones we previously made in class, however with more usability and features. The most challenging thing I experienced during this assignment was coding the check for the account information inputs which were the name and account number. I went through moments where when my code completed this check, it would stop running and when it didnâ€™t, it would allow the user to create multiple accounts under the same account number or skip straight to the menu after entering their name. I overcame this by creating a list of account numbers to check through to check if the user entered an existing account number and rather than having one instance where my menu runs at the end of the loop, I had it run in two instances where certain conditions had to be met. Something I would do differently given what I know now is using array Lists more frequently because of the flexibility they have over regular java arrays. It was helpful to build on a project I already built in lab because it allowed me to focus my efforts on the new requirements, using my prior experience to work on the more basic methods. Through this hardship I do feel more comfortable with classes. I feel okay with arrays. I would like to better find out how to sort through them.
